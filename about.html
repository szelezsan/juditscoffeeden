        <p>Hi, my name is Judit. If you made it here you are probably wondering why learn from me how to brew coffee either in your home or is a professional environment.</p>
        <p>I have eight years of management experience in speciality cafe management. As part of my daily job was to teach new colleagues how to brew the perfect coffee, even in the busiest times. 
       My goal was always to give my best tips and tricks to everyone, as i believe you are only as good as your team.</p>
        <p>The last two cafe's I worked at I helped designing counter spaces to use space up to it's maximum potential, and make it useful for everydays.</p>
        <p>My very last job was a coffee trainer/coffee quality manager for a coffee roasting company in Ireland. That meant all the clients were recieveing training either on site or in a training fascility.</p>
        <p>I created this website to give you opportunity to learn professional coffee making or home brewing techniques.
       It is up to you now to reach your potential and get a step closer to the perfect cuppa.</p>

        <p>Happy brewing!

    Judit</p>
