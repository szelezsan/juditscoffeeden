        <h3>Coffee tips for home brewers</h3>
                <p class="coffee-tips">You might struggle with your home brew or just simply want to get better result of you espresso at work. Let me share some of my absolute lifesaver tips with you. We've all been there and it can pretty frustrating, when you are not getting real results. But I am here to help you get started, and if you are still stuck, you can message me any time and I will reply in a timely manner.</p>
        <h3>Basics</h3>
                <p class="coffee-tips"><strong>First comes first</strong>, everything you use during the brewing matters. From the water you are using till the coffee beans. What most time works for me may not work for you and really coffee is a try and error kind of thing, as everyone likes their coffee differently.
                So there is no wrong or right technique really until the finish result is what you were looking for.</p>

                <p class="coffee-tips"><strong>Equipment</strong> wise you should have a decent home grinder, with sharp blades. My favourite is the Commendante hand grinder. It does a very good job on consistent grind size, which we are looking for when making coffee. If your grindsize varies a lot it can result an unbalanced cup, as the grindsizes will soak up different amount of water and will brew differently. 
                If you have a lot of fine particles it can cause clogging, and you water might not get through the coffee bed.</p>

                <p class="coffee-tips"><strong>Filter paper</strong> again something you might not think to change, but there are some which have resulted us an unsucccesful brew. So to save you time, I will link good filter papers for V60, aeropress, calita and so on in the Paper filter esction below.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Different brewing methods</strong> will require different grind size and water pouring technique. You can watch brewing videos under <a href="homebrew-videos.html">Videos</a>. I would say over the years I was trying the majority of the home brewers and techniques, but I always go back to my trusty aeropress or V60 and to my basic techniques.
                Sometimes I feel all these new techniques were created to draw attention, but it is not practical, and just complicated sometimes for homebrewers.</p>

                <p>And if you feel like you've tried everthing and your coffee is still not good, then it might be your water. Tap waters usually don't give good result, due to hardness, limescale and other stuff. Bottled water might not have the right mineral content, and minerals in water can change how your coffee taste.</p>

        <h3>Espresso</h3>
          <p>In this section I will talk about espresso. This concentrated drink is very misunderstood and many thinks it is suppose to be bitter and that means strong coffee.
            While we know this is not true, there are a lot of misconceptions about espresso (sometimes it is even being pronounced wrong- expresso).
            
            If you are a homebrewer you probably have a much easier job with your espresso machine, as it adjust itself when grinding a coffee <a href=https://www.sageappliances.com/ie/en/products/espresso/bes875.html>
            Like this Sage one</a>, so you really should focus on the water and coffee bean quality.
            But if you have a grinder and a coffee machine seperately, setting the grind size is definately crutial.</p>
            <p>The next couple of illustrations will help you. Full context can be found <a href="https://bigcupofcoffee.com/coffee-grind-size-chart-guide/" target="blank">here.</a></p>

           <img src="assets/images/brewmethods.png" alt="Coffee grind size chart with brewing methods"></div>
        <h3> Water</h3>
          <p>I briefly mentioned water before in the previous chaper. There are a few things to discuss here. First: hardness of the water: Too soft or too hard water can alter the taste of your coffee.
            By Speciality coffee Assosiation there is a golden standard for this:SCA (Speciality Coffee Association) standards for minerals: total hardness of 50-175 ppm CaCO3 (2,9-9,8 dH°), carbonate hardness of 40-75 ppm CaCO3 (2,2-4,2 dH°), pH of 6-8.
          There are test kits you can use at home to find out your water hardness. You can read more about water testing <a href="https://prima-coffee.com/blog/testing-your-water/">on this website.</a>
          <div>Some links if you want to buy water hardness test:

          <div class="retail-links"><a href="https://www.jesuk.com/brita-temp-hardness-test-kit.html" target="_blank">Brita Temp Hardness Test Kit</a></div>

        </div>
        Also the content of you water at home migh not be suitable. Being said, 90% that you tap water is not good for brewing.
